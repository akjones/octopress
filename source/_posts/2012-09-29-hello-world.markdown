I'm a software developer from Sydney, Australia. I work as a consultant with [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com 'ThoughtWorks').

This is a project I've been meaning to start for years, but it somehow kept getting put off. I intend to post stuff I've learned or find interesting, mostly to help me make sure I've understood it by explaining it to someone else. Hopefully others will occasionally find something useful here.

This is just a quick post to get me started and motivated to get this thing published. More soon!
